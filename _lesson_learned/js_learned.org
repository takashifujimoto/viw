* Javascript Lesson Learned


** Adding event handlers

    document.body.addEventListener('keydown', body_onKeyDown);  


** CSS Selector

selecting the first <a class="selected">#</a>  in item id="nav"


    document.getElementById('id').querySelector('a.selected');


** XPath
    XPath is faster than CSS Selector.
    But its lerning curve is high.

** Event Listner

If you are done using, eventhandler, get rid of it. (though not many developer do this).

*** Backspace key
PROBLEM:  when I hit backspace key, the browser navigates back.
SOLUTION: if the keyCode == 8, then set event.returnValue = false;
